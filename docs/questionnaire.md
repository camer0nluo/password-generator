# Questionnaire

## How much time did it take you?
It took me two hours. I utilized the time constraint to accomplish as much as I could within the given timeframe.

## How did you think about testing your code?
For the logical portion, I dedicated my time to writing unit tests specifically for the password store, which I created for password generation. On the UI side, I conducted manual testing within the browser.

## How did you verify your solution meets the requirements?
I carefully read through the requirements, ensuring a clear understanding of what was expected. To validate my solution, I manually tested each test case and maintained a checklist to keep track of completed tasks.

## What tradeoffs did you make and why?
Due to time constraints, I couldn't address UI bugs, such as the password input bug that interferes with icons when the input is too long. The bar meter for password strength wasn't implemented; instead, I opted for displaying strength as text. I also skipped writing unit tests for the UI, relying on manual testing. Although manual testing helped, I acknowledge it may not catch all bugs, and in the future, I plan to create a test plan before coding.

## Shortcuts are encouraged to keep the time investment of the assignment minimal. What shortcuts did you take? Anything you specifically want to mention that you wouldn't normally do?
Initially, I created a first version of the logical portion but wasn't satisfied with it, so I started over and approached it differently. To calculate password strength, I used a library as I lacked clarity on the best method.

## What was tricky and why?
Considering all edge cases was challenging, and I admit I didn't cover them thoroughly. Designing a visually appealing interface was also tricky without a concrete design in mind. I selected random words for a memorable password, unsure of the exact definition. UI bugs were present but were not addressed due to time constraints; my focus was primarily on functionality during the limited two-hour period. I speculate that using a UI library might have resulted in a smoother process.
